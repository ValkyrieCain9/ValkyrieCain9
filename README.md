  I‚Äôm currently completing a Master's degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge at the University of Bologna. I am a programmer at heart, with an     interest in data science, linked open data and the semantic web.
  When I'm not working on projects you can find me reading, watching anime, listening to music or going on walks to do some photography.
  Below you can find some of my recent projects which have given me the chance to combine my computational studies with my humanities and arts interests.
