  I’m currently studying and MA in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge at the University of Bologna. I am a programmer at heart, with an interest in data science, linked open data and the semantic web. You can find some of my recent projects below.

## Projects

### ⚔ VinLOD Saga
VinLOD Saga is a linked-open data project which brings together ten diverse cultural heritage objects, all conceptually linked to the anime and manga Vinland Saga. Explore the cultural echoes behind these artifacts and join us on a journey through Norse legends, ancient symbols, and timeless stories brought to life through heritage.

### 🧭 Far FroMM HoMMe
Far From Home is an digital exhibition which explores the many ideas and concept of home. The featured artworks are found in a variety of musuems and art instituations from around the world. It uses front-end languages to contruct the exhibitions interface and backend technologies which connect the various metadata into a single uniform standard.
